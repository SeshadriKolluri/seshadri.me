I am currently working as a Data Scientist at [Apple](https://apple.com). In my previous life, I worked on developing Gallium Nitride FETs at [Texas Instruments](https://ti.com) and [Efficient Power Conversion](https://epc-co.com/epc).

This website is for my notes on various things, and some weekend projects.
