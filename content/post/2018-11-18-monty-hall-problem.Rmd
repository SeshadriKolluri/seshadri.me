## Problem Description

[Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) is one of the most popular probability puzzles. The problem describes a game show where there are three doors. One of the doors contains a prize behind the door, and the other two doors don't have the prize behind them.  

The rules of the game are as the following.

-   You first choose a door and let the host know. (**Original Choice**, `r knitr::asis_output("\U25FD")`).
-   The host knows which door has the prize, and opens one of the the doors that don't have the prize behind them. This door is then eliminated. (**Eliminated Choice**, `r knitr::asis_output("\U25FE")`).
-   You now have the option of sticking with your Original Choice, or changing to the other remaining door after elimination (**Alternate Choice**, `r knitr::asis_output('<span style="color:#FFE4C4">\U25A6</span>')`).

The question is whether you are better off sticking to your **Original Choice**, or switching to the **Alternate Choice** after the elimination, or if it **doesn't matter**.

## Solution

Apparently an overwhelming majority of the people think that it doesn't matter whether you stick to your original choice or change your choice to the remaining door, as both of them are expected to have 33% chance of success originally, but it is now well known that the chances of success are better if we switch to the remaining door after elimination. We will try to understand it in a few different ways. 

### Approach 1 - A Thought Experiment

Let us assume we choose **Door 3** initially. Now imagine **Door 1 + Door 2** as one unit, and **Door 3** as the second unit as shown below. We can see that the probability of success for the **Door 1 + Door 2** unit is 2/3. Now, imagine if the host gives us the ability to choose that entire unit (consisting of two doors) instead of **Door 3**. We would obviously choose that unit as it has a 2/3 probability of success. When the host eliminates **Door 2** and gives you an option to choose **Door 1** (or he eliminates **Door 1** and gives us the option to choose **Door 2**), he is effectively giving us an option to choose the entire unit of **Door 1 + Door 2**. So, when we leave our original choice (**Door 3**) behind, and **switch to this other non-eliminated door** in the two door unit, we have a higher probability of success (2/3).

While the above explanation may be intuitive enough for some people, it may still appear a little hand-waving. So, we will explore a couple more approaches below. 

### Approach 2 - Simulations

We can verify if logic from the above argument is true, by simulating this experiment a large number of times. In this section, we simulate the experiment 30 times (for simplicity), and use the visuals below to understand the results. The simulations and visuals were generated using **R programming language**. You can **see the code by clicking on the code button** below. 

```{r data-generation}
set.seed(2017)

# number of runs
n <- 30

# make a dataframe containing three columns called door1, door2, door3.
# Each row should contain two "goat"s and one "car", randomly distributed
# among three columns

car_positions <- sample(1:3, n, replace = TRUE)

# run the experiment chosen number of times
df_experiment_runs <-
  ldply(car_positions, function(x)
    ifelse(1:3 == x, "car", "goat"))
names(df_experiment_runs) <- c("Door1", "Door2", "Door3")
df_experiment_runs$`Run Number` <-
  as.numeric(row.names(df_experiment_runs))
df_experiment_runs$`First Choice` <- sample(1:3, n, replace = TRUE)
df_experiment_runs$`Prize Location` <- car_positions
df_experiment_runs$`Eliminated Position` <- apply(
  df_experiment_runs,
  MARGIN = 1,
  FUN = function(x) {
    (
      setdiff(1:3, c(x['Prize Location'], x['First Choice']))
        [sample(length(setdiff(1:3, c(x['Prize Location'], x['First Choice']))), 1)]
    )
  }
)

df_experiment_runs$`Alternate Choice` <- apply(
  df_experiment_runs,
  MARGIN = 1,
  FUN = function(x) {
    (
      setdiff(1:3, c(x['Eliminated Position'], x['First Choice']))
        [sample(length(setdiff(1:3, c(x['Eliminated Position'], x['First Choice']))), 1)]  
    )
    
  }
  
)

df_experiment_runs_long <- pivot_longer(df_experiment_runs,
                                        cols = starts_with("Door"),
                                        names_to = "Door")
df_experiment_runs_long$Door <-
  gsub('Door', '', df_experiment_runs_long$Door)

df_legend <-
  expand_grid(
    Choices = c(
      "Prize Location",
      "Original Choice",
      "Winning Original Choice",
      "Eliminated Choice",
      "Alternate Choice"
    )
  )
df_legend$Choices <- fct_inorder(df_legend$Choices)

# Generate a plot to be used for the legend.
get_legend_plot <- function(df) {
  ggplot(df, aes(x = Choices, fill = Choices, y = 1)) +
    geom_tile(color = 'gray50',
              width = 0.15,
              height = 1) +
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 2)) +
    facet_grid(~ Choices, scales = 'free') +
    geom_point(data = df %>% filter(grepl("Prize Location|Winning", Choices)), size = 0.5) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c('white', 'gray80', 'gray80', 'gray30', 'bisque')) +
    theme_void() +
    
    theme(
      legend.position = 'none',
      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 9),
      strip.text = element_blank()
    )
} 
```

#### 1. Prize locations chosen at random:

First, let us denote the Prize Locations in each of the 30 runs by a **dot (.)**, which is chosen randomly among the 3 doors. 

```{r prize-location}
p0 <-
  ggplot(df_experiment_runs_long, aes(y = `Run Number`, x = Door)) +
  geom_tile(fill = 'white', color = 'gray40') +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(0, 0)) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = expansion(0, 0)) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    legend.position = 'none',
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  )

p1 <-
  p0 + geom_point(data = df_experiment_runs, aes(x = `Prize Location`), size = 0.5) +
  # labs(subtitle = 'Prize Locations') +
  NULL

annotate_figure(
  ggarrange(
    ggarrange(
      get_legend_plot(head(df_legend, 1)),
      NULL,
      NULL,
      NULL,
      NULL,
      nrow = 1,
      align = 'h'
    ),
    NULL,
    ggarrange(p1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, nrow = 1, align = 'h'),
    nrow = 3,
    heights = c(1, 0.2, 10)
  ),
  #
  #     ncol = 2, align = 'h'
  left = text_grob("Experiment Number", rot = 90, size = 12),
  bottom = text_grob(
    "Door Choice",
    size = 12,
    hjust = 0,
    x = 0.05
  )
)

```


#### 2. Original door choice chosen at random:

Then, let us show the original choice of the doors, denoted by gray square (`r knitr::asis_output("\U25FD")`), which are also shown at random. 

```{r original-choice}
p2 <-
  p0 + geom_tile(
    data = df_experiment_runs,
    aes(x = `First Choice`),
    fill = 'gray80',
    color = 'gray40'
  ) #+
# labs(subtitle = 'Original Choice')
annotate_figure(
  # ggarrange(p1,     p2, get_legend_plot(head(df_legend,2)), NULL, NULL, nrow = 1, align = 'h'),
  ggarrange(
    ggarrange(
      get_legend_plot(head(df_legend, 2)),
      NULL,
      widths = c(0.4, 0.6),
      nrow = 1,
      align = 'h'
    ),
    NULL,
    ggarrange(p1, p2, NULL, NULL, NULL, nrow = 1, align = 'h'),
    nrow = 3,
    heights = c(1, 0.2, 10)
  ),
  left = text_grob("Experiment Number", rot = 90, size = 12),
  bottom = text_grob(
    "Door Choice",
    size = 12,
    hjust = 0,
    x = 0.15
  )
)

```

#### 3. Original choice combined with prize locations:

When we combine the above two plots, we can see how many times we choose the door containing a prize indicated by a gray square with a dot in the picture below. 

`Number of successes with original choice: number of gray squares with a dot`. 

In the plot below, we can say about 10 out of 30 trials result in a success where the prize location, is same as the original choice, as expected, with about 0.33 probability. 

```{r original-choice-with-prize-location}
p3 <-
  p2 + geom_point(data = df_experiment_runs, aes(x = `Prize Location`), size = 0.5) #+
#labs(subtitle = 'Original Choice\n+\nPrize Location')

annotate_figure(
  # ggarrange(p1, p2, p3, get_legend_plot(head(df_legend,3)), NULL, nrow = 1, align = 'h'),
  ggarrange(
    ggarrange(
      get_legend_plot(head(df_legend, 3)),
      NULL,
      widths = c(0.6, 0.4),
      nrow = 1,
      align = 'h'
    ),
    NULL,
    ggarrange(p1, p2, p3, NULL, NULL, nrow = 1, align = 'h'),
    nrow = 3,
    heights = c(1, 0.2, 10)
  ),
  left = text_grob("Experiment Number", rot = 90, size = 12),
  bottom = text_grob(
    "Door Choice",
    size = 12,
    hjust = 0,
    x = 0.25
  )
)
```

#### 4. Eliminating one of the doors without the prize:

At this point the host would eliminate one of the doors that don't contain the prize. We denote this eliminated choice by black square (`r knitr::asis_output("\U25FE")`).


```{r eliminated-positions}
p4 <-
  p3 + geom_tile(
    data = df_experiment_runs,
    aes(x = `Eliminated Position`),
    fill = 'gray30',
    color = 'gray40'
  ) #+
#labs(subtitle = 'Original Choice\n+\nEliminated Choice')
annotate_figure(
  # ggarrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, NULL, nrow = 1, align = 'h'),
  ggarrange(
    ggarrange(
      get_legend_plot(head(df_legend, 4)),
      NULL,
      widths = c(0.8, 0.2),
      nrow = 1,
      align = 'h'
    ),
    NULL,
    ggarrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, NULL, nrow = 1, align = 'h'),
    nrow = 3,
    heights = c(1, 0.2, 10)
  ),
  left = text_grob("Experiment Number", rot = 90, size = 12),
  bottom = text_grob(
    "Door Choice",
    size = 12,
    hjust = 0,
    x = 0.35
  )
)
```

#### 5. Considering the alternate choice:

After one of the doors, is eliminated we have the option of changing our choice to the alternate door, which is denoted by the orange square (`r knitr::asis_output('<span style="color:#FFE4C4">\U25A6</span>')`) in this picture. 

`Number of successes with alternate choice: number of orange squares with a dot`. 

We can see that there about 20 orange squares with a dot in this experiment of 30 runs, which is about twice the probability of success compared to the original choice. 

```{r alternate-choice}
p5 <-
  p0 + geom_tile(
    data = df_experiment_runs,
    aes(x = `Eliminated Position`),
    fill = 'gray30',
    color = 'gray40'
  ) +
  geom_tile(
    data = df_experiment_runs,
    aes(x = `Alternate Choice`),
    fill = 'bisque',
    color = 'gray40'
  ) +
  geom_point(data = df_experiment_runs, aes(x = `Prize Location`), size = 0.5) #+
#labs(subtitle = 'Alternate Chocie\n+\nPrize Location')

annotate_figure(
  # ggarrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, nrow = 1, align = 'h'),
  ggarrange(
    get_legend_plot(head(df_legend, 5)),
    NULL,
    ggarrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, nrow = 1, align = 'h'),
    nrow = 3,
    heights = c(1, 0.2, 10)
  ),
  left = text_grob("Experiment Number", rot = 90, size = 12),
  bottom = text_grob(
    "Door Choice",
    size = 12,
    hjust = 0,
    x = 0.45
  )
)
```

**So, changing our choice after the elimination of one of the doors, improved the success probability by about 2x.**

### Approach 3 - Exact Probability Calculations

Though the previous simulations make sense, they do not provide a definitive proof that switching our door choice would increase our probability of success to 2/3. As a matter of fact, there could be a different set of 30 simulation runs, where the results could be the opposite of what we got (though less likely). So, in this section we try to provide more rigorous permutations-based calculations to get these probabilities.
