<h2>Problem Description</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall Problem</a> is one of the most popular probability puzzles. The problem describes a game show where there are three doors. One of the doors contains a prize behind the door, and the other two doors don’t have the prize behind them.</p>
<p>The rules of the game are as the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>You first choose a door and let the host know. (<strong>Original Choice</strong>, <span style="color:#FFE4C4">▦</span>).</li>
<li>The host knows which door has the prize, and opens one of the the doors that don’t have the prize behind them. This door is then eliminated. (<strong>Eliminated Choice</strong>, ◽).</li>
<li>You now have the option of sticking with your Original Choice, or changing to the other remaining door after elimination (<strong>Alternate Choice</strong>, <span style="color:#87CEFA">▦</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The question is whether you are better off sticking to your <strong>Original Choice</strong>, or switching to the <strong>Alternate Choice</strong> after the elimination, or if it <strong>doesn’t matter</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="solution" class="section level2">
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Apparently an overwhelming majority of the people think that it doesn’t matter whether you stick to your original choice or change your choice to the remaining door, as both of them are expected to have 33% chance of success originally, but it is now well known that the chances of success are better if we switch to the remaining door after elimination. We will try to understand it in a few different ways.</p>
<div id="approach-1---a-thought-experiment" class="section level3">
<h3>Approach 1 - A Thought Experiment</h3>
<p>Let us assume we choose <strong>Door 3</strong> initially. Now imagine <strong>Door 1 + Door 2</strong> as one unit, and <strong>Door 3</strong> as the second unit as shown below. We can see that the probability of success for the <strong>Door 1 + Door 2</strong> unit is 2/3. Now, imagine if the host gives us the ability to choose that entire unit (consisting of two doors) instead of <strong>Door 3</strong>. We would obviously choose that unit as it has a 2/3 probability of success. When the host eliminates <strong>Door 2</strong> and gives you an option to choose <strong>Door 1</strong> (or he eliminates <strong>Door 1</strong> and gives us the option to choose <strong>Door 2</strong>), he is effectively giving us an option to choose the entire unit of <strong>Door 1 + Door 2</strong>. So, when we leave our original choice (<strong>Door 3</strong>) behind, and <strong>switch to this other non-eliminated door</strong> in the two door unit, we have a higher probability of success (2/3).</p>
<p><img src="/montyhall/approach_1.png" style="width:80.0%" />
While the above explanation may be intuitive enough for some people, it may still appear a little hand-waving. So, we will explore a couple more approaches below.</p>

<div id="approach-2---simulations" class="section level3">
<h3>Approach 2 - Simulations</h3>
<p>We can verify if logic from the above argument is true, by simulating this experiment a large number of times. In this section, we simulate the experiment 30 times (for simplicity), and use the visuals below to understand the results. The simulations and visuals were generated using <strong>R programming language</strong>. You can <strong>see the code by clicking on the code button</strong> below.</p>

<h3>Approach 3 - Exact Probability Calculations</h3>
<p>Though the previous simulations make sense, they do not provide a definitive proof that switching our door choice would increase our probability of success to 2/3.

So, in this section we try to provide more rigorous permutations-based calculations to get these probabilities.</p>

Next step is for the host to eliminate one of the two un-chosen doors. However, he cannot eliminate a door which has a prize. So, some of the permutations above result in two choices for the host to eliminate from, and in the other cases, the host can eliminate only one of the doors.</p>
<p>In permutations 1, 5, and 9, the host has two choices for the door elimination, and hence these can be divided into permutations 1a, 1b, 5a, 5b and 9a, 9b respectively with half the probability each (1/18) after the elimination step. For the other permutations, the host has only one choice for elimination, so the probability of that permutation remains unchanged at 1/9 both before and after elimination, as shown below.</p>

<p>Now, if we add up all the probabilities for Winning Alternative Choices (<code>Blue squares with a dot</code>), we can see that they add up to 6/9 or 2/3. Similarly if we add all the probabilities for the Winning Original Choices (<code>orange squares with a dot</code>), we can see that they add up to 6/18 or 1/3. So, we have conclusively proved that changing our choice after the host eliminates one of the doors is the better option.</p>

<p>We have a looked at the Monty Hall problem in 3 different ways to arrive at the same answer. I hope this gives you better insight into this problem.</p>
