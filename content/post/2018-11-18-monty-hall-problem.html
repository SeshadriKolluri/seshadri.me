<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall Problem</a> is one of the most popular probability puzzles. In this post, we explore the intuition behind the problem.</p>
<div id="problem-description" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem Description:</h3>
<p>The problem describes a game show where there are three doors. One of the doors contains a prize behind the door, and the other two doors don’t have the prize behind them.</p>
<p>The rules of the game are as the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>You first choose a door and let the host know. (<strong>Original Choice</strong>, ◽).</li>
<li>The host knows which door has the prize, and opens one of the the doors that don’t have the prize behind them. This door is then eliminated. (<strong>Eliminated Choice</strong>, ◾).</li>
<li>You now have the option of sticking with your Original Choice, or changing to the other remaining door after elimination (<strong>Alternate Choice</strong>, <span style="color:#FFE4C4">▦</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The question is whether you are better off sticking to your <strong>Original Choice</strong>, or switching to the <strong>Alternate Choice</strong> after elimination as your new choice, or if it <strong>doesn’t matter</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="solution" class="section level3">
<h3>Solution:</h3>
<p>Apparently an overwhelming majority of the people think that it doesn’t matter whether you stick to your original choice or change your choice to the remaining door, as both of them are expected to have 33% chance of success originally, or 50% chance of success after you eliminate a door that doesn’t contain the prize. But, let us try to arrive at the answer in a more careful way.</p>
<p>We start with a frequentist approach where we repeat the experiment 30 times, and see how many successes we have with each approach.</p>
<p>We use <code>R programming language</code> to simulate the experiment 30 times, and we use the plots to understand the results. You can <code>see the code by clicking on the code button</code> below.</p>

<div id="discussion" class="section level3">
<h3>Discussion:</h3>
<p>The above example showed that we have twice the chance of succeeding by changing our initial choice.</p>
<p>To understand this further, we can imagine our initial choice as one unit, and the remaining two doors as another unit. The probability of having a prize in our initial choice is 0.33. So, the probability that the prize is one of the remaining two doors is 0.67.</p>
<p><code>When the host eliminates one of the doors that doesn't contain the prize, he is effectively giving us a chance to choose two doors together</code>: one of the doors that doesn’t contain the prize, and the other one which we didn’t choose initially. So, the probability of the prize being in that unit of two doors together is 0.67. This is another way to understand this problem.</p>
